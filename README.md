# Predictive Modeling of a Geophysical Parameter
Problem: The density structure of the Earth's deep continental lithosphere is a major unknown. While surface topography is a key observable, its signal is a complex mix of contributions from the crust, the deep mantle, and the lithosphere itself.

Method: This project isolates the topographic contribution of the sub-cratonic lithospheric mantle (SCLM). We developed a model that deconstructs observed topography, removing the known effects of crustal isostasy and the estimated effects of dynamic mantle flow. The remaining residual signal is then used to model the density structure of the SCLM.

Outcome: The model successfully links the residual topography to the depth of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). This allows us to determine the vertical distribution of density anomalies, providing a clear method for inferring deep-earth properties from surface-level data.
